     <p> My game is a variation of a Snake game. You start by clicking the level you want. The easy level moves slower than the hard level. After clicking the level <br> you want the game starts. You must start by moving right. You are not allowed to move the opposite direction you are going, for example if you are moving <br> right you cannot go left, and if you are going up you canâ€™t immediately go down. You get points by getting the food under the direct center of the snake. The goal <br> of the game is to get 20 points. If any part of the snake touches the border of the game the game is ended and you lost.</p>
